# Hello World 👋

Welcome to my blog! This is where I'll be sharing my journey through the world of **cybersecurity**, **full-stack development**, and everything in between.

## What to Expect

- 🏴 **CTF Write-ups** — Detailed walkthroughs of capture-the-flag challenges
- 🛡️ **Security Deep-dives** — Exploring vulnerabilities, exploits, and defenses
- 💻 **Coding Tutorials** — Practical guides in both Hinglish and English
- 🔧 **Troubleshooting Guides** — Solutions to problems I've encountered

## Why Hinglish?

Because not everyone is comfortable reading purely in English, and mixing in Hindi makes technical content more accessible to a huge audience. Knowledge should have no barriers.

## Let's Go!

Stay tuned for more content. If you want to collaborate or have questions, hit me up on [GitHub](https://github.com/yourusername) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/yourusername).

```python
print("Hello, World! 🚀")
